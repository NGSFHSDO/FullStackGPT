Press the tofu to remove excess water by wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and placing a heavy object on top for about 15-30 minutes.\\n2. Cut the tofu into thin slices or cubes, depending on your preference.\\n3. Marinate the tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, and a pinch of black pepper for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.\\n4. Cook the marinated tofu in a pan over high heat until browned and slightly crispy on the outside.\\n\\n**Tempeh:**\\n1. Cut the tempeh into thin slices or cubes.\\n2. Steam the tempeh for about 10 minutes to soften it and remove any bitterness.\\n3. Marinate the tempeh in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, and a pinch of black pepper for at least 30 minutes.\\n4. Cook the marinated tempeh in a pan over high heat until browned and slightly crispy on the outside.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can easily substitute the beef in the Bibimbap recipe with tofu or tempeh while still enjoying a flavorful and satisfying vegetarian version of this traditional Korean dish.\")"
